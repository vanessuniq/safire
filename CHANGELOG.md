## [Unreleased]

### Added

- SMART Backend Services Authorization flow (`client_credentials` grant) via
  `Safire::Client#request_backend_token` and `Safire::Protocols::Smart#request_backend_token`:
  - Authenticates exclusively via a signed JWT assertion (RS384 or ES384); no redirect,
    PKCE, or user interaction required
  - Scope defaults to `["system/*.rs"]` when none is configured or provided
  - `private_key` and `kid` can be overridden per call
- `token_response_valid?` now accepts a `flow:` keyword argument (`:app_launch` default):
  when `flow: :backend_services`, also validates `expires_in` presence (required per
  SMART Backend Services spec)
- `token_response_valid?` accepts both `"Bearer"` (SMART App Launch spec) and `"bearer"`
  (SMART Backend Services spec) as valid `token_type` values; the non-compliance warning
  now references the expected value for the active flow

### Changed

- `redirect_uri` and `authorization_endpoint` are now optional in `Safire::Protocols::Smart`;
  both are validated only when `authorization_url` is called (app launch flow)
- `redirect_uri` is now optional in `Safire::ClientConfig` to support backend services
  clients that operate without a redirect URI; the field is still validated when provided

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `Safire::Client` facade with `protocol:` (`:smart`) and `client_type:`
  (`:public`, `:confidential_symmetric`, `:confidential_asymmetric`) keywords
- SMART on FHIR App Launch 2.2.0 support via `Safire::Protocols::Smart`:
  - Server metadata discovery from `/.well-known/smart-configuration`
  - Authorization URL builder for GET and POST-based authorization
    (`authorize-post` capability)
  - Authorization code → access token exchange
  - Token refresh
- PKCE (S256) support with per-request code verifier generation
- Private key JWT assertion (`private_key_jwt`) for confidential asymmetric
  clients; RS384 and ES384 auto-detected from the key type
- Token response validation (`token_response_valid?`) per SMART App Launch
  2.2.0 §Token Response
- `Protocols::Behaviours` contract module defining the required protocol
  interface
- Sensitive data filtering in HTTP request/response logs
- SSL verification warning when `ssl_options: { verify: false }` is configured
- HTTPS-only redirect enforcement with an exception for localhost
- Configurable logger, HTTP logging toggle, and `User-Agent` header via
  `Safire::Configuration`
- `Safire::ClientConfigBuilder` for constructing `ClientConfig` with a fluent
  interface
